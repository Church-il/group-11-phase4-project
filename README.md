## Features

### 1. Full CRUD for Projects, Create and Read for Users and Resources
- **Projects**:
  - Full CRUD operations implemented in `routes.py`.
  - Endpoints:
    - `POST /api/projects` - Create a project.
    - `GET /api/projects` - Retrieve all projects.
    - `GET /api/projects/<id>` - Retrieve a specific project.
    - `PUT /api/projects/<id>` - Update a project.
    - `DELETE /api/projects/<id>` - Delete a project.
- **Users**:
  - Read functionality implemented via the `/users` endpoint (`GET` method).
- **Resources**:
  - Read functionality implemented via the `/resources` endpoint (`GET` method).

### 2. Build RESTful API Endpoints Supporting Relationships
- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-Many: `User` ‚Üí `Project`
  - One-to-Many: `Project` ‚Üí `Resource`
- Relationships are defined in `models.py` and utilized in endpoints to enable seamless data access and updates.

### 3. Ensure Consistent API Responses
- **Marshmallow Schemas** (`schemas.py`):
  - Serialize and deserialize models for API responses.
  - Ensure a consistent response format across endpoints.
- **Error Handling**:
  - `404` responses for missing resources using `get_or_404`.
  - Status codes like `201` for creation and `204` for successful deletion.

### 5. Interactive Data & Visualizations

We believe in the power of information. That's why we've added interactive charts and maps to track renewable energy progress across Kenya. You'll be able to see how many people in your area are benefiting from renewable energy projects and watch the impact grow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Models & Relationships

### 1. User Model

- **Attributes:** 
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `password_hash`
  - `profile_picture`
  - `role`
  - `location`
- **What it does:** A user can create projects. These projects are tied to the user's location (like **Kiambu** or **Nairobi**), ensuring everything stays local and relevant.

### 2. Project Model

- **Attributes:**
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `status`
  - `date_created`
  - `user_id`
  - `location`
- **What it does:** Every project has its own details, and it's linked to both a user and the resources it needs to succeed in a specific region.

### 3. Resource Model

- **Attributes:**
  - `name`
  - `description`
  - `type`
  - `link`
  - `region`
- **What it does:** Resources like funding, supplies, and government programs support the projects. These are region-specific, whether it's for **Nairobi** or **Kisumu**, ensuring users always have access to what's needed for their local area.

## üîó Relationships

### One-to-Many Relationships

- **User to Project:** A user can create multiple projects, each tailored to their region.
- **Project to Resources:** Projects use many resources, whether it's money, materials, or expertise.

### Many-to-Many Relationship

- **Project-Resource:** A project can rely on multiple resources, and a resource can be used in many projects. We even track how much each resource is contributing to the project's success.

## üé® Frontend Pages
